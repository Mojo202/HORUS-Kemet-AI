# Cursor Agent Data Access

## Overview
This repository was created to access and process Cursor agent conversation data from the URL:
```
https://cursor.com/agents?selectedBcId=bc-89bdb1ce-f9e2-4db0-a1f4-e703b692633a
```

## Findings

### URL Structure
- **Base URL**: `https://cursor.com/agents`
- **Browser Conversation ID**: `bc-89bdb1ce-f9e2-4db0-a1f4-e703b692633a`

### Access Limitations

After investigation, I found that:

1. **Web Interface**: The URL points to a Next.js web application that loads conversation data dynamically
2. **No Public API**: There is no publicly accessible API endpoint to retrieve the conversation data
3. **Authentication Required**: The conversation data appears to be protected and likely requires authentication
4. **Client-Side Rendering**: The page uses React Server Components and loads data client-side after authentication

### Attempted Endpoints

Tested the following endpoints without success:
- `GET https://cursor.com/api/agents/bc-89bdb1ce-f9e2-4db0-a1f4-e703b692633a` - Returns 404
- `GET https://api.cursor.com/agents/bc-89bdb1ce-f9e2-4db0-a1f4-e703b692633a` - Returns 404
- `GET https://www2.cursor.com/api/conversation/bc-89bdb1ce-f9e2-4db0-a1f4-e703b692633a` - No response

## Recommendations

To access Cursor agent conversation data, you would need:

1. **Authentication**: Log in to Cursor with valid credentials
2. **Browser Automation**: Use tools like Playwright or Puppeteer to authenticate and scrape the data
3. **Official API**: Contact Cursor support to request official API access if available
4. **Export Feature**: Check if Cursor provides an export feature for conversations within the application

## Alternative Approaches

### Option 1: Browser Automation
```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch()
    page = browser.new_page()
    # Navigate and authenticate
    page.goto('https://cursor.com/agents?selectedBcId=...')
    # Wait for data to load
    # Extract conversation data
```

### Option 2: Direct Access via Cursor Application
If you have access to the Cursor desktop application, conversation data may be stored locally in:
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Cursor`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Cursor`

## Next Steps

Please clarify:
1. Do you have authentication credentials for Cursor?
2. Is this your own conversation or one you have permission to access?
3. Would you like me to set up browser automation to access the data?
4. Do you have access to the Cursor desktop application to export data locally?
